%\section{Guidelines} \label{guide}

%\par \nar Before we begin, let us first consider a few features in this book implemented to help communicate its contents.  


%\par \nar The first thing you will notice is that the text and story line have been segmented into a “box” structure.  This is used to define and communicate different levels of education needed as a minimum by the reader to understand certain key concepts contained within each “level”.  For example, level zero is shown in black text, and is not confined to any such boxes.  This “zeroth level” contains most of the underlying story line, and can be understood by readers having a base level of education attained in grade school (i.e., up to and including high school).  It does not require any knowledge of any text appearing in any other “levels” in order to understand its contents.  If the reader chooses to read only the black text, then they will be able to follow along with the story but will neglect access to some of the higher-level education materials presented in this book.  

%\par \nar Subsequent “higher” levels require more education to understand their contents.  All of the corresponding “higher level” education materials are contained within, and isolated to, the box format described above.  Level one is indicated by red boxes and lettering, and requires a basic undergraduate STEM-based education to understand the content.  All text appearing in red boxes assumes that the reader is following along with all text appearing in both red and black fonts.  Level two is indicated via blue boxes, and requires an education in undergraduate physics to comprehend.  All text appearing in blue boxes assumes that the reader is following along with all text appearing in blue, red and black boxes.  Level three is indicated via green boxes and lettering, and is aimed at the graduate level.  And so on.  

%\par \nar In summary, each level of text, indicated by a different type of box and lettering, and requiring the indicated background education, requires knowledge of the content of each level below it, but no knowledge of any level above it.  In principle, the reader can begin to appreciate the book from a very young age and, if they so choose, return to it again and again over the course of their life as their own personal education develops.  Each time the reader re-discovers this book, we hope they will discover new things, with new content emerging as it becomes accessible to them.

%\par \nar Now, we know what you are thinking:  "How on Earth am I supposed to safely navigate my way through Level 0, when I'll be dodging around or even fumbling right through Level 1, or Level 2 or, have mercy, Level 3!  This sounds hard.  If reading this book is anything like playing a video game, players on Level 0 are going to need an infinite number of lives to complete it." 

%\par \nar Rest assured, we have taken great care to ensure for every reader a safe, secure and pleasant journey through each and every chapter, independent of their level of education.  This includes granting users on Level 0 an infinite number of lives.  
%This is accomplished by clearly segmenting off any text associated with higher levels that require a more specialized knowledge to access or understand.  To this end, 
%The key point to keep in mind is that we use colored text to indicate to the reader the level associated with that text, and boxes to indicate that the text should only be regarded by readers at the appropriate level, and ignored otherwise.  For example, if you are only reading Level 0, then you can safely ignore any and all colored text and boxes, without any details being lost from the principle story line following our main characters.  If you are still feeling reluctant, try to keep in mind that a paper cut is probably the worst thing that could happen to you upon reading our book.  Of course, this assumes you are not carrying any explosive devices on your person. In that case, exploding is probably the worst thing that could happen to you.

%PYRAMID DIAGRAM SHOWING THE COLORS AND CORRESPONDING EDUCATION LEVELS?  Obviously, the highest level of education goes at the top, indicating all levels below it are required to follow the story development in these sections.  The base of the pyramid should be in black, given the above descriptions.

%\par \nar The second thing you will notice is that the characters in the story appear in corresponding illustrations.  These are included not just for entertainment purposes, but are instead primarily used to help convey the underlying story and certain key concepts.  We do our best to ensure that the illustrations are accurate and precise in terms of the underlying physics, to help communicate important concepts typically related to the physics governing the birth and subsequent evolution of stars.  For example, the sizes and colors of the stars in the story are accurate, given their relative masses.
