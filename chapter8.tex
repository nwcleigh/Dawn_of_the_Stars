\chapter{The Making of a Millisecond Pulsar...}

\newpara \nar \rmmerope~ was now a proud neutron star.\footnote{DEFINE NEUTRON STAR.}  But she was a little too close to \rmmaia~ for comfort; plasma was being pulled from \rmmaia's equator, venturing toward \rmmerope~ and gathering around her equator as an accretion disk.\footnote{DEFINE ACCRETION DISK.  CAN WE INCLUDE AN ILLUSTRATION OR SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM?}  Viscosity caused the disk to diffuse inward until, from the inner boundary of the accretion disk, material began to flow and accreted on to \rmmerope's surface.\footnote{EXPLAIN/DEFINE VISCOSITY, AND PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF ACCRETION.}  The material brought in angular momentum, causing \rmmerope~ spin rate to slowly increase over time.\footnote{EXPLAIN HOW THIS WORKS IN MORE DETAIL USING CONSERVATION OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM. FIGURE SKATERE EXAMPLE?}

\newpara \Merope Whoa, I am so sorry about this.  I did not mean to accrete from you.

\newpara \Maia It is not your fault, sister.  The sudden change in our orbital parameters due to your supernova explosion caused it.\footnote{DEFINE ORBITAL PARAMETERS, BUT MAKE SURE IT HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE...IT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE.}  You, of course, had no say in any of that.

\newpara \Merope I did not but, I cannot help but wish that I were smarter, and could have thought of some way to deliver us to a less dramatic outcome.

\newpara \Maia Oh, my sister.  I do love you for your tenacity.  But, still, it is not your fault, and you must let it go.  After all, I feel fine.  I am slowly losing mass to you, but the consequences seem quite benign so far.  How are you doing?

\newpara \Merope Oh, I am rotating ever faster.  On the one hand, it is making me \textit{very} dizzy.  \textit{But}, on the other hand, I can feel the excess energy stored within me.  It feels like... well, power.  I sort of like it.  Should I be ashamed?\footnote{EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF ROTATIONAL KINETIC ENERGY, AND MOMENT OF INERTIA.}

\newpara \Maia No, I do not think so.  Power can be spent for good, and the prosepct of doing good should indeed make you feel warm inside.  So, in the end, it is up to you how you decide to spend your new-found power.

\newpara \Merope  Well, to be honest, it seems at the moment like storing it away is the best thing for us all.  But I do hope the the day will come that my new-found rotational energy will prove critical to improving the state of the Universe.

\newpara \Maia And that is one of the many reasons why I love you, sister.  

\newpara \Merope Uh... I think I am rotating...carry the 1...about once every...uh...millisecond... Can that even be right?
%NL: Does the above ``joke'' work?

\newpara \Maia Let me see.

\newpara \nar \rmmaia~ watched intently as \rmmerope~ rotated.  A keen eye, she was able to count the number of rotations over a given minute, and from there calculate the rotation rate per second.\footnote{BRIEFLY REVIEW THIS CONCEPT.}

\newpara \Maia Holy cow!  You are right! You rotate roughly once every 10 milliseconds!  That is \textit{very} fast.  

\newpara \Merope Wow.  It feels like I am rotating quickly, but hearing the exact number really drives it home.  Okay, well, I'll be over here waiting for something to impart all this rotational kinetic energy to, hopefully for the greater good. 

\newpara \nar \rmmerope continued to accrete from \rmmaia, although most of the infalling matter was now being expelled via the ``propeller effect''; \rmmerope now possessed strong magnetic fields, that repelled incoming charged particles.  As \rmmaia lost mass, the distance separating her from \rmmerope grew; their orbital separation was increasing.\footnote{DO A SIMPLE CALCULATION USING CONSERVATION OF ENERGY AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM TO ILLUSTRATE THIS.}  Regardless, \rmmaia had a large enough radius that she continued to fill her Roche lobe\footnote{The Roche lobe defines the critical distance from the center of a star's mass beyond which gravity will pull matter away from the star's surface and on to its binary companion. DIAGRAM?}, steadily losing mass to \rmmerope.  Eventually, \rmmaia had lost so much mass she hardly felt like herself anymore.

\newpara \Maia Wow, I have been widdled away, sister!  I am but a shadow of my former self.  I must have lost most of my original mass.  

\newpara \Merope I am sorry, sister.  How do you feel?

\newpara \Maia Hmmm... Fine considering, I suppose.  I am starting to sweat a little a bit though.  Do I look hot at the surface?

\newpara \Merope Now that you mention it, you are glowing somewhat.  And your color has changed. You're much whiter than before.

\newpara \Maia Hmmm...  Well, this is embarrassing.  I feel as though my core has been exposed.\footnote{BRIEF NOTE ON STELLAR STRUCTURE, AND WHITE DWARFS.}    

\newpara \nar \rmmerope~ closed her eyes, turning away from \rmmaia.

\newpara \Merope Don't worry, sister.  I am not looking.  Your privacy is safe with me.

\newpara \Maia Well, that is very considerate.  But... I do not see how to cover up, now that my envelope is gone. I fear you will have to accept me as I now am.

\newpara \nar \rmmerope~ turned back toward her sister, a smile spread across her face.

\newpara \Merope I will take you in any form, sister.  I am just glad that you are okay.  How do you feel?
%NL Is this chapter perhaps a little cheesy?  If so, someone want to take a crack at editing accordingly?

\newpara \Maia Well, all things considered, I feel okay.  Hotter, a lot more compact, certainly less luminous, but otherwise fine.\footnote{REVIEW HOW ALL THIS TIES IN TO THE PROPERTIES OF WHITE DWARFS.}  How do I look?

\newpara \nar \rmmaia~ put her hands on her hips, and swiveled back and forth.  Glamorous did not do her justice.

\newpara \Merope Wonderful!  You have never been more symmetric!  I am truly jealous!

\newpara \Maia Oh, please, your symmetry is perfect.  

\newpara \Merope Not with all this rotation.  Look at \textit{this}.

\newpara \nar \rmmerope~ pointed angrily at her equator. 

\newpara \Merope I have a bulge!  A bulge!

\newpara \Maia Sister, you are still the most beautiful of all the Universe's creatures.
%NL: Yep, definitely got cheesy...  Dammit.

\newpara \Merope There is no doubt that you are my sister.  And even less doubt that I love you termendously.

\newpara \nar \rmmaia~ and \rmmerope, out of reach, extended open arms toward each other.  Clawing futilely at vacuum in each other's general direction for but a few seconds, they quickly exchanged a mutual glance of loving understanding, and then ceased their frantic flailing.
