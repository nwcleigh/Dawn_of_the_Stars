\section{A Tale of Two Black Holes...}

$\Sterope$ wandered through her host cluster for millions of years.  She endured many encounters with the other denizens of the cluster, but it took several before she met even one black hole.  Finally, she stumbled upon a suitable target.  $\Sterope$ had managed to exchange herself in to a normal stellar binary by the time she encountered the first black hole.  As the black hole drew close, its gravity pulled $\Sterope$ and her companion toward it.  A chaotic three-body interaction ensued.  A delicate dance, the three bodies bobbed and weaved by each other, continually accelerated by each other's mutual gravitational attraction but without imparting enough kinetic energy to escape, destined to return to rejoin the melee.  The dance continued until, eventually, $\Sterope$'s original companion was ejected, flung off at high velocity to what amounts to spatial infinity in $\Sterope$'s reference frame.

\Sterope Uh... Hello there... Wherever you are.  I can't actually see you, you being completely black and all.  But I know you're there!  I must be orbiting \textit{something}, after all.

\Ares You are not alone.  It is I, $\Ares$.  Star destroyer.  Devourer of worlds.

\Sterope That sounds ominous.  I'm pleased to meet you.

$\Sterope$ extends an eager hand, hoping for a handshake but suddenly realizing $\Ares$ could easily be out of reach.

\Ares You aren't scared?

\Sterope Scared of what?

\Ares Me!  I just said I destroy stars!

\Sterope Oh.  Right.  Well I wish you the best of luck with that, but so far you seem nice enough.

$\Ares$ lets out a long sigh.

\Ares All this mass, and nobody around here seems to care.  What gives?

\Sterope I don't know, but \textit{I} sure care.  That's why I came looking for you.  I need an object of significant mass to help me escape from this cluster.  Well, two massive objects to be precise.  

\Ares Ah, you are in need of a gravitational assist!  A slingshot from a massive body.  Finally, a use for me!

\Sterope Yes!  You could be very useful to me.  

\Ares Wonderful.  I feel useful already.

\Sterope Okay, so, how do we do this?

\Ares Well, I guess I could take a run toward you, and maybe that would work?

\Sterope I don't think so.  We are gravitationally bound.  I do believe we need at least some form of outside interference to unbind us.  After all, the excess energy must come from somewhere.

\Ares Fair enough.  We need another black hole.

\Sterope Exactly!  But I am confident that, between the two of us, we can find one.

\Ares I might know where.  My brother is lurking around here somewhere. 

\Sterope You're brother?!

\Ares $\Zeus$! $\Zeus$!  Where are you, brother?

A long silence passed.  $\Sterope$, excited at the propsect of a second black hole, listened closely for a response.

\Zeus I am here.   

\Ares  Wonderful.  Good to hear your voice again, brother.

\Zeus And you, brother.

\Ares I have met a friend, $\Sterope$, who requires assistance.

\Zeus  Hello, $\Sterope$.  Nice to meet you.

\Sterope And you, $\Zeus$.  Truly, this is intimidating.  You are both \textit{so} massive.

\Zeus Do not be intimidated, child.  We are here to help.

\Ares Indeed.  $\Sterop$ is in need of a gravity assist, to escape from this cluster.

\Zeus I see.  Well, you seem kind, noble and out of place here amongst these old stars.  I am happy to offer my mass in the name of this cause.  But how do you propose we get the job done?

\Ares As god of war, I have facilitated many a squirmish in this cluster environment.  As I see it, there is no better way to impart a velocity kick of sufficient magnitude to eject $\Sterope$ from the cluster.  Us three must engage in a chaotic dance, choreographed by none other than gravity.

\Zeus  Very well.  I am coming toward you.  Prepare yourselves for chaos.

$\Zeus$ drifted ever closer to $\Sterope$ and $\Ares$, slowly at first but rapidly gaining speed.  Before they knew it, $\Zeus$ was upon them, tugging them in every which direction, and vice versa.  Chaos ensued.  The two black holes and $\Merope$ completed a series of wild loops and orbits before.  More than a few times, $\Merope$ passed close enough to one of the black holes to really feel their gravitational might;  matter was pulled from her surface after making her closest approach. Not much, but enough to freak out both her and her interloping black hole; each time, they exchanged a startled glance.  Finally, $\Merope$ was ejected at high velocity, leaving $\Ares$ and $\Zeus$ bound in a new binary.    

\Ares I think that should do it.  

\Zeus Agreed.  She must be flying at above the escape velocity.  

\Ares Fare thee well, $\Merope$!  May only glorious adventures befall you!

\Merope Thanks so much, to the both you!  Free at last!

Sure enough, $\Merope$ escaped from the gravitational bounds of her temporary host cluster with kinetic energy to spare.  Her trajectory now pointed inward, back toward the heart of the Galaxy.
