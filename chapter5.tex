\section{}

After the dissolution of their natal star cluster, $\Maia$ and $\Merope$ wandered through the Galactic Disk.  Millenia passed without much in the way of interruption; $\Maia$ had only $\Merope$ to keep her company, and vice versa.  Now and again, the sisters encountered a passing star off in the distance, too far away to exchange a conversation with.  Regardless, they yelled relentlessly, eager to meet a new face.  After a few million years of this, the pair had grown bored, but inseparable.

$\Merope$'s age was now showing.  The most massive of her siblings, she had been destined to burn through her nuclear fuel the fastest.  She was now reaching the end of her short life.  As such, she had begun to expand, slowly entering the red giant phase of stellar evolution.  

\Maia Uh... I don't mean to alarm you, $\Merope$, but I've noticed you've been expanding lately.  I mean, just a little bit.  No big deal, really.  But, uh, where do you suppose this is heading?

\Merope Uh... Well, I hadn't noticed, to be honest.  But now that you mention it I do feel a little bloated.  

\Maia Well, you look \textit{great}, that's for sure.

\Merope Thank you, sister.  But I fear this isn't going to get better before it gets worse.  Much, much worse.  I seem to be expanding further...

\Maia Oh dear.  Well, don't panic.  We'll figure this out.  How do you feel?

\Merope I feel... Like I might have a fever.  Do I look hot to you?

\Maia Eeesh... Yeah, kind of.  You've been getting steadily redder in color.  It's not drastic, but it is noticeable.

\Merope Um... Okay, maybe if I hold my breath.  Here I go...

$\Merope$ drew in a deep breath, and held it.  The minutes passed.  Her face blue, $\Merope$ eventually exhaled in defeat.  

\Merope Oh no.  That was uncomfortable.  And I am still expanding.

\Maia Don't panic.  We'll sort this out.

\Merope You already said that!

\Maia Well, frankly, I can't emphasize it enough.  Just... Don't panic.

\Merope You aren't making me feel any better over here.

\Maia I'm sorry.  I'm doing my best... I know I said not to panic, but I'm losing it over here myself...  Yep, I'm dropping the ball.  Big time.

\Meropa  Jeez, $\Maia$, get ahold of yourself.  I'm the one who is apparently expanding to certain doom, and yet you are the one hyperventilating.

Flabbergasted, $\Maia$ struggled to regain her composure.

\Maia It's fine.  I'm fine.  How are you doing?

\Merope Well, quite honestly, I continue to expand.  How do I stop?

\Maia Have you tried thinking really hard about \textit{contracting}?

\Merope Really?  I'm about to die, and your big idea is to think good thoughts?  

\Maia Well, it can't hurt...

\Merope You aren't helping!  I should tear you a new one...

\Maia A new \textit{what}?

\Merope Nevermind, $\Maia$, we have more important things to deal with!

By this time, $\Merope$ had already expanded by over an order of magnitude, and her radius was growing rapidly.  

\Maia I'll go get help!

\Merope And how are you going to do that?  We're gravitationally bound.

\Maia Oh right.  Gravity.  I'll think good thoughts?

$\Merope$ sighs in defeat.

\Merope I'm going to die for sure.

\Maia Don't say that, $\Merope$!  You're not going to die.

For some time, it seemed $\Maia$ was right.  Although $\Merope$ continued to expand and contract over the next few million years, she eventually grew accustomed to it.  Just another day in the life of a massive star.

But then one day, suddenly and without warning, $\Merope$ exploded.  A supernova.  Plasma and gore flew passed $\Maia$, spraying her face with the guts of $\Merope$ and knocking her backward.  The blast was asymmetric, escaping mostly from a preferred side which happened to oppose $\Merope$'s orbital motion almost perfectly.  Due to momentum conservation, this meant a significant and almost instantaneous reduction in $\Merope$'s orbital velocity and a loss of orbital angular momentum.  $\Merope$ drifted inward, closer to $\Maia$ and on a much more eccentric orbit than before.  

\Maia $\Merope$! Are you alright?!  

\Merope Uh... I think so.  Give me a minute here.  I feel much lighter.

\Maia Well you did just eject your outer envelope and most of your mass in a rather dramatic supernova explosion.  So it makes sense that you are much less massive now.  You look so small and compact!  

\Merope Thank you!  I feel pretty svelte over here.  Looking good, feeling good.  Who would have thought exploding could be such a positive experience.

A worried expression appeared suddenly on $\Merope$'s face.

\Maia What's wrong?

\Merope Does your belly always do that?

$\Maia$ looked down to discover her midsection had grown distended.  A bulge pointed directly toward $\Merope$.  As $\Merope$ re-approached pericenter, the bulge grew and a thin stream of material began to flow from $\Maia$'s surface toward $\Merope$.

\Maia Holy cow!  Now I'm losing mass! Okay, don't panic.

\Merope I swear, if you say that one more time I'm going to scream.
